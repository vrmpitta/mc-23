      <h2>My Chart Guide Patient Portal – Refund Policy</h2>
      <p>At My Chart Guide, we are committed to providing a secure, transparent, and patient-friendly billing experience through the My Chart Guide Patient Portal. This Refund Policy outlines how payments made through the portal are handled and the circumstances under which refunds may be issued.</p>

      <h3>Payment Processing</h3>
      <p>Payments made through My Chart Guide are applied to your account based on your outstanding balance and service history. You may use the portal to pay:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Medical bills for services rendered</li>
        <br>
        <li>Co-pays and deductibles</li>
        <br>
        <li>Charges related to appointments, procedures, or treatments</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All transactions are processed in U.S. dollars (USD) using a secure, PCI-compliant payment system.</p>

      <h3>Eligibility for Refunds</h3>
      <p>Refunds may be issued under the following conditions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Overpayment – </strong>If a payment is made in excess of the amount due on your account</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Duplicate Payment – </strong>If the same charge is paid more than once</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Canceled Services – </strong>If a scheduled service is canceled and no fees are applicable</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Billing Errors – </strong>If a payment was made based on an incorrect or outdated statement</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you believe a payment was made in error, please contact our billing department within 30 days of the transaction to request a review.</p>

      <h3>Refund Processing Time</h3>
      <p>Once a refund request is reviewed and approved, it will be processed within 7 to 10 business days. Refunds will be issued to the original method of payment used. In some cases, the time it takes for the funds to appear in your account may vary depending on your bank or credit card provider.</p>

      <h3>Non-Refundable Charges</h3>
      <p>The following charges are typically non-refundable:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Payments applied correctly to outstanding balances</li>
        <br>
        <li>Services that have already been rendered</li>
        <br>
        <li>Fees associated with missed or late-canceled appointments (unless waived)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Third-party processing or convenience fees (if applicable)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Questions and Support</h3>
      <p>We’re here to help. If you have questions about your balance, insurance adjustments, or refund status, please don’t hesitate to contact our billing support team. Clear communication is part of our commitment to your overall healthcare experience.</p>
